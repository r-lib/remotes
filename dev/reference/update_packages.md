# Update packages that are missing or out-of-date.

Works similarly to
[`utils::install.packages()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html)
but doesn't install packages that are already installed, and also
upgrades out dated dependencies.

## Usage

``` r
update_packages(
  packages = TRUE,
  dependencies = NA,
  upgrade = c("default", "ask", "always", "never"),
  force = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  build = TRUE,
  build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual", "--no-build-vignettes"),
  build_manual = FALSE,
  build_vignettes = FALSE,
  repos = getOption("repos"),
  type = getOption("pkgType"),
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- packages:

  Character vector of packages to update.

- dependencies:

  Which dependencies do you want to check? Can be a character vector
  (selecting from "Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests", or
  "Enhances"), or a logical vector.

  `TRUE` is shorthand for "Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo" and
  "Suggests". `NA` is shorthand for "Depends", "Imports" and "LinkingTo"
  and is the default. `FALSE` is shorthand for no dependencies (i.e.
  just check this package, not its dependencies).

  The value "soft" means the same as `TRUE`, "hard" means the same as
  `NA`.

  You can also specify dependencies from one or more additional fields,
  common ones include:

  - Config/Needs/website - for dependencies used in building the pkgdown
    site.

  - Config/Needs/coverage for dependencies used in calculating test
    coverage.

- upgrade:

  Should package dependencies be upgraded? One of "default", "ask",
  "always", or "never". "default" respects the value of the
  `R_REMOTES_UPGRADE` environment variable if set, and falls back to
  "ask" if unset. "ask" prompts the user for which out of date packages
  to upgrade. For non-interactive sessions "ask" is equivalent to
  "always". `TRUE` and `FALSE` are also accepted and correspond to
  "always" and "never" respectively.

- force:

  Deprecated, this argument has no effect.

- quiet:

  If `TRUE`, suppress output.

- build:

  If `TRUE` build the package before installing.

- build_opts:

  Options to pass to `R CMD build`, only used when `build` is `TRUE`.

- build_manual:

  If `FALSE`, don't build PDF manual ('–no-manual').

- build_vignettes:

  If `FALSE`, don't build package vignettes ('–no-build-vignettes').

- repos:

  A character vector giving repositories to use.

- type:

  Type of package to `update`.

to see which packages are out of date/ missing.

## Examples

if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
update_packages("ggplot2")
update_packages(c("plyr", "ggplot2"))
} # }
